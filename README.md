#### About discord.py
For the current moment (April 2024) latest discord.py release (2.3.2) doesn't provide proper handle of disconnection, raising exceptions which break the event loop, so it has to be installed right from github with pip-command:
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py.git --force-reinstall
```

### Prepare to launch
1. Download the repository
```

cd GCSKampe-3.0
