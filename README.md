#### About discord.py
For the current moment (April 2024) discord.py doesn't provide proper handle of disconnection, raising exceptions which break the event loop. So it should be installed with custom crutch:
```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/EvieePy/discord.py.git@fix/temp-voice --force-reinstall
```
This lib's bug has been reported in official discord.py discord-server by me, so the official actual fix should be ready soon â€” this kind of discord.py installation is a temporary need
